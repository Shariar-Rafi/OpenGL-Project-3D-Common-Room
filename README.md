# OpenGL-Project-3D-Common-Room

## **Overview**

This project is a 3D rendering of a common room designed using OpenGL. It showcases advanced computer graphics techniques such as lighting, texturing, camera movement, and object modeling. The room features multiple table-chair sets arranged , surrounded by walls and flooring that create a realistic, immersive environment.

This project is a practical demonstration of 3D graphics programming, highlighting:
- Interactive navigation through the room using a camera.
- Realistic lighting effects (ambient, diffuse, and specular).
- Properly scaled and positioned 3D objects like tables, chairs, and walls etc.
